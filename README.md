# 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based sketchpad inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.  
This project was built as part of **The Odin Project’s Foundations Course** to practice **DOM manipulation**, **Flexbox**, and **JavaScript fundamentals**.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This interactive sketchpad allows users to:
- Draw by hovering the mouse over grid squares.
- Customize the grid size (up to 100×100).
- Reset and regenerate grids dynamically.
- Experiment with color and shading effects.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – Styling and Flexbox grid system  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation and event handling  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project management

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The JavaScript file dynamically generates a grid of divs inside a container.
2. Each div reacts to mouse hover by changing color.
3. A button lets the user input a new grid size (via prompt).
4. The grid resizes within the same fixed container area.
5. For extra credit, each hover can:
   - Assign a **random RGB color**, or  
   - Gradually **darken** the color by 10% on each pass.
